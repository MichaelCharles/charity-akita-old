<h1>Vote</h1>
<h2>Pro-Elections or Pro-Merit?</h2>

<p><strong>The poll is open!</strong></p>

<p><em>Make sure to read the <a href="index.htm?page=elections">"Pro-Elections"</a> and <a href="index.htm?page=merit">"Pro-Merit"</a> arguments before voting!</em></p>

<p><em>To prevent people from voting more than once, after you cast your vote, either <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010015411462">write "voted" on the AAJ Facebook wall</a> or send <a href="mailto:AkitaAAJ@gmail.com">an email to AkitaAAJ@gmail.com</a> with your full name and stating that you have voted.</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/293KDSZ">Click here to vote!</a></h3>

<p>The poll opened on Friday July 3, and will close on Tuesday July 7 at 10pm. Provided that these rules are followed, results will be revealed on July 8th.</p>

<p>Please vote by the deadline. We understand this is a short period of time, but the end of the year (July 31) is soon approaching and with many JETs leaving soon, we wanted to have this sorted out as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Whatever the outcome of the poll, ALTs who are interested in being a part of AAJ for the next JET year should get in touch with the current AAJ team members by email as soon as possible.</p>

<h1>AAJ Elections Poll</h1>

<p>A second community meeting was held on the evening of Tuesday June 30 to discuss the future of Akita Association of JETs (AAJ). The main topic discussed at the meeting was the process by which members should be decided upon in the future.</p>

<p>In previous years, members came forward to volunteer and were assigned roles based on their abilities, commitment, and enthusiasm. Anyone within the community with an interest in helping others, organizing events and bringing the Akita JET community together, was able to volunteer with the prospect of becoming a full fledged member of the AAJ leadership, given that they showed dedication and potential. However, in the recent community meetings, people have expressed a desire to see the AAJ leadership positions appointed by popular vote.</p> 

<p>As AAJ is a community-involved group, we would like you to decide which you would prefer via a poll. Members of the community have outlined a "Pro-Election" argument, advocating we change the system to have annual elections, and a "Pro-Merit" argument, advocating that the positions continue to be chosen by appointment as they have in the past.</p>

<p>As this is an important decision for the future of AAJ, please read the arguments below carefully and take time to consider your response.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="index.htm?page=elections">Read the Pro-Elections Argument</a></strong></p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="index.htm?page=merit">Read the Pro-Merit Argument</a></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><a href="index.htm?page=vote">Vote!</a></h3>
<p>

<p>Whatever format for selecting the AAJ leadership is decided upon, the future leadership itself will be governed by a charter currently being developed by community leaders selected for their previous experience working with NPOs and community associations.</p>

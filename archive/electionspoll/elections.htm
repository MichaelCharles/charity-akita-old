<h1>Pro-Elections</h1>

<p>After the incident that has occurred this year, in regards to Kenneth Grant, a new step for bringing new life into the current AAJ committee is to hold an election.</p>

<p>Elections would be a yearly occurrence, where new and existing committee members would campaign for their desired role. This is a process that AAJ has never tried before but could help bring new life into the committee. As AAJ is considered a community-driven association, all members of the Akita community should have the opportunity to elect the roles within it. This responsibility provides a sense of power to shape the way in which people would like to see their community represented. This is also a great opportunity for people to be heard and a prospect of trust to develop between community and committee members. Elections lastly provide an opportunity for new members of the JET community to step forward.</p>


<p>Deciding the committee titles via election encourages all interested members of the community to campaign for their desired role. </p>

<p><strong>Elections are a perfect medium to  ensure that the roles are taken seriously by the individual. Individuals who are successful in acquiring that role are also held up to a level of accountability and are aware of the repercussions of not fulfilling said role.</strong></p>

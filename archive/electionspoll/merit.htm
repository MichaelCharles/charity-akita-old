<h1>Pro-Merit</h1>

<p><strong>Election by popular vote, while a powerful tool for selecting representative positions, is not suited for choosing the leadership positions of this organization.</strong> Voting makes perfect sense for choosing, for example, the president of a school club, because that position is inherently representative in nature. Voting ensures representation, but it does not ensure competence or expertise. This is why we do not vote for teachers, grocery store managers, or leadership positions in most charities. As such, in AAJ as well, it would be more appropriate for the leadership positions to be chosen by those intimately familiar with the job requirements of the positions, and not by the wider community.</p>

<h2>Arguments for Selecting AAJ Leadership by Appointment on Merit</h2>

<p><strong>Selecting new leaders by appointment on merit ensures that only those who have shown prior commitment, have demonstrated that they are trustworthy, and who know what the job entails are chosen for leadership positions.</strong> The leadership positions in AAJ are serious commitments that demand a great deal of time, energy, and in some cases, money. Persons taking on these positions are not only taking on stewardship of resources and expensive equipment bought and maintained by past AAJ leaders, but are entrusted to continue relationships cultivated by them as well.</p>

<p><strong>Selecting new leaders by appointment will help preserve the important personal relationships that are crucial for continued cooperation with the wider Akita community.</strong> In Japanese culture in particular, having a common personal connection between business partners is important. AAJ leadership builds vital relationships with venue owners and local businesses. An aspect of continuity within leadership is necessary to maintain those relationships.</p>

<p><strong>The current AAJ leadership is better equipped to choose new candidates for leadership positions than the wider JET community.</strong> Having worked with dedicated volunteers who have demonstrated their commitment, the current AAJ leadership knows exactly what each person brings to the table, and whether or not they have the know-how and perseverance to ensure that AAJ is as successful as it can be.</p>

<p><strong>Selecting new leaders by appointment means that recruitment is always happening.</strong> The current leadership would continually be on the lookout for potential successors among current volunteers, and make a conscious effort to introduce talented, committed volunteers to the jobs required of positions before asking them to take over for them. They would introduce potential candidates to the responsibilities that each position entails while teaching them how to do the many jobs that would be required of them.</p>

<h2>Arguments against Selecting AAJ Leadership by Popular Vote</h2>

<p><strong>Instituting a practice of selecting AAJ leadership by popular vote would not have, in and of itself, prevented or even deterred the current situation involving the embezzlement of money by Kenneth Grant.</strong> While choosing leaders by popular vote would likely give the community a feeling of ownership when it comes to problems like these, it would not actually better deter situations like these from occurring. After all, one can be a very outgoing and likable person, but still end up being untrustworthy, as has been proven recently. It is a risk that is taken when choosing leadership regardless of whether it's done through appointment or popular vote. However, the current leadership knows the strengths and weaknesses of the people they're appointing to replace them in much better detail than one could get from any kind of campaign materials. It would be more effective to fix the system by which the money is handled, rather than change the way that leadership is chosen.</p>

<p><strong>The election process could easily turn into a popularity contest which would run the risk of electing leadership based more on a candidate’s charisma and self-marketing than on their demonstrated capabilities and past efforts.</strong> While promoting oneself for an elected position does take a certain amount of dedication and effort on the candidate's behalf, candidates may not be fully aware of the level of work that goes into events and other AAJ activities, and so it is possible that they may fall short of the demands of the position, both in terms of talent and effort. AAJ leadership inherits thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment and resources, and it is imperative that their management is passed down to candidates that have been proven to be trustworthy and capable.  </p>

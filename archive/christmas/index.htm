<h1><a name="doThey"></a>Do They Know It's Christmas?</h1>
<h2>Band Aid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE"> (YouTube)</a></h2>
<p>It's Christmastime, there's no need to be afraid<br>
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade<br>
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy<br>
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime</p>
<p>But say a prayer, Pray for the other ones<br>
At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun</p>
<p>There's a world outside your window<br>
And it's a world of dread and fear</p>
<p>Where the only water flowing<br>
Is the bitter sting of tears<br>
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom<br>
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you<br>
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime<br>
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life</p>
<p>Where nothing ever grows<br>
No rain nor rivers flow<br>
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?<br>
Here's to you<br>
Raise a glass for everyone</p>
<p>Spare a thought this yuletide for the deprived<br>
If the table was turned would you survive</p>
<p>Here's to them<br>
Underneath that burning sun<br>
You ain't gotta feel guilt just selfless<br>
Give a little help to the helpless<br>
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?</p>
<p>Feed the world<br>
Feed the world<br>
Feed the world<br>
Feed the world<br>
Feed the world<br>
Let them know it's Christmastime again - [repeated]</p>
<p>Feed the world<br>
Feed the world - [repeated to end]</p>

<h1><a name="imagine"></a>Imagine</h1>
<h2>John Lennon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRhq-yO1KN8"> (YouTube)</a></h2>
<p>Imagine there's no heaven<br>
It's easy if you try<br>
No hell below us<br>
Above us only sky<br>
Imagine all the people<br>
Living for today</p>
<p>Imagine there's no countries<br>
It isn't hard to do<br>
Nothing to kill or die for<br>
And no religion too<br>
Imagine all the people<br>
Living life in peace</p>
<p>You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
But I'm not the only one<br>
I hope someday you'll join us<br>
And the world will be as one</p>
<p>Imagine no possessions<br>
I wonder if you can<br>
No need for greed or hunger<br>
A brotherhood of man<br>
Imagine all the people<br>
Sharing all the world</p>
<p>You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
But I'm not the only one<br>
I hope someday you'll join us<br>
And the world will live as one</p>

<h1><a name="lastChristmas"></a>Last Christmas</h1>
<h2>Wham! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8gmARGvPlI"> (YouTube)</a></h2>
<p>[Chorus (2x):]<br>
Last Christmas<br>
I gave you my heart<br>
But the very next day you gave it away.<br>
This year to save me from tears<br>
I'll give it to someone special.</p>
<p>Once bitten and twice shy<br>
I keep my distance<br>
But you still catch my eye.<br>
Tell me, baby,<br>
Do you recognize me?<br>
Well, It's been a year,<br>
It doesn't surprise me<br>
(Merry Christmas)</p>
<p>I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
With a note saying, &quot;I love you,&quot;<br>
I meant it<br>
Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
But if you kissed me now<br>
I know you'd fool me again</p>
<p>[Chorus 2x]</p>
<p>Oh, oh, baby.</p>
<p>A crowded room,<br>
Friends with tired eyes.<br>
I'm hiding from you<br>
And your soul of ice.<br>
My god I thought you were someone to rely on.<br>
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.</p>
<p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart.<br>
A man under cover but you tore me apart, ooh-hoo.<br>
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again.</p>
<p>[Chorus 2x]</p>
<p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)<br>
A man under cover but you tore him apart<br>
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone<br>
I'll give it to someone special.</p>

<p>I'm dreaming of a white Christmas<br>
Just like the ones I used to know<br>
Where the tree-tops glisten and children listen<br>
To hear sleigh bells in the snow</p>

With every Christmas card I write<br>
&quot;May your days be merry and bright<br>
And may all your Christmases be white&quot;</p>

Fingers numb, faces aglow.</p>

A time for trusting, not deceiving,<br>
Love and laughter and joy ever after,<br>
Ours for the taking, just follow the master.</p>

<p>A long time ago in Bethlehem<br>
So the Holy Bible say<br>
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ<br>
Was born on Christmas Day</p>
<p>While Shepherds watched their flocks by night<br>
They saw a bright new shinging star<br>
And hear a choir from heaven sing<br>
The music seemed to come from a far</p>
<p>Hark now hear the angels sing<br>
A new King born today<br>
That man will live for evermore<br>
Because of Christmas Day.</p>
<p>(Mary's boy child, Mary's boy child<br>
Was born on christmas day)</p>
<p>Now Joseph and his wife Mary<br>
Came to Bethlehem that night<br>
And in a stable cold and dark<br>
The boy was born of glorys light</p>
<p>Hark now hear the angels sing<br>
A new King born today<br>
That man will live for evermore<br>
Because of Christmas Day.</p>
<p>(Mary's boy child, Mary's boy child,<br>
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ)</p>
<p>Trumpets sound and angels sing<br>
Listen to what they say<br>
That man will live for evermore<br>
Because of Christmas Day</p>
<p>Hark now hear the angels sing<br>
A new King born today<br>
That man will live for evermore<br>

Happy golden days of yore<br>
Faithful friends who are dear to us<br>
Gather near to us once more</p>

And folks dressed up like Eskimos<br>
Everybody knows, a turkey and some mistletoe<br>
Help to make the season bright</p>
<p>Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow<br>
Will find it hard to sleep tonight<br>
They know that Santa's on his way<br>
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh<br>
And every mothers child is gonna spy<br>
To see if reindeer really know how to fly<br>
And so I'm offering this simple phrase<br>
To kids from one to ninety two<br>
Although it's been said many times, many ways<br>
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas<br>
Merry Christmas to you</p>

I'm riding in the midnight blue<br>
I'm finding i can fly so high above with you</p>
<p>Far across the world<br>
The villages go by like dreams<br>
The rivers and the hills<br>
The forests and the streams</p>
<p>Children gaze open mouth<br>
Taken by surprize<br>
Nobody down below believes their eyes</p>
<p>We're surfing in the air<br>
We're swimming in the frozen sky<br>
We're drifting over icy<br>
Mountains floating by</p>
<p>Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep<br>
Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep</p>
<p>We're walking in the air<br>
We're floating in the midnight sky<br>
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly</p>

<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
Everywhere you go;<br>
Take a look at the five and ten<br>
It's glistening once again<br>
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.</p>
<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
Toys in every store<br>
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br>
On your own front door.</p>
<p>A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots<br>
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;<br>
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk<br>
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;<br>
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.</p>
<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
Everywhere you go;<br>
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,<br>
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.</p>
<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;<br>
Soon the bells will start,<br>
And the thing that will make them ring<br> is the carol that you sing<br>
Right within your heart</p>
<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>

We're riding in a wonderland of snow<br>
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand<br>
Just holding your hand<br>
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land</p>
<p>Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we<br>
We've snuggled close together like two birds of a feather would be<br>
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two<br>
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you</p>
<p>There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray<br>
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day<br>
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop<br>
At the fireplace where we'll watch the chestnuts pop<br>
Pop, pop, pop</p>
<p>There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy<br>
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie<br>
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives<br>
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives<br>

<h2>The Shropshires <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzV9DIL_vrM"> (YouTube)</a></h2>
<p>[Chorus:]<br>
Grandma got run over by a reindeer<br>
Walking home from our house Christmas eve<br>
You can say there's no such thing as Santa<br>
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe</p>
<p>She'd been drinking too much eggnog<br>
And we'd begged her not to go<br>
But she'd left her medication<br>
So she stumbled out the door into the snow</p>
<p>When they found her Christmas morning<br>
At the scene of the attack<br>
There were hoof prints on her forehead<br>
And incriminating Claus marks on her back</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Now were all so proud of Grandpa<br>
He's been taking this so well<br>
See him in there watching football<br>
Drinking beer and playing cards with cousin Belle</p>
<p>It's not Christmas without Grandma<br>
All the family's dressed in black<br>
And we just can't help but wonder<br>
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>Now the goose is on the table<br>
And the pudding made of fig<br>
And a blue and silver candles<br>
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig</p>
<p>I've warned all my friends and neighbors<br>
Better watch out for yourselves<br>
They should never give a license<br>
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves</p>

Walkin' in the winter wonderland</p>

Here to stay is a new bird<br>
He sings a love song, as we go along<br>
Walkin' in the winter wonderland</p>
<p>In the meadow we can build a snowman<br>
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown<br>
He'll say &quot;Are you married?&quot;<br>
We'll say &quot;No man!<br>
But you can do the job when you're in town&quot;</p>
<p>Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire<br>
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made<br>
Walkin' in the winter wonderland</p>
<p>Over the ground lies a mantle of white<br>
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night<br>
Two hearts are thrillin'<br>
In spite of the chill in the weather<br>
Love knows no season, love knows no clime<br>
Romance can blossom any old time<br>
Here in the open<br>

Together, together, together</p>

And pretend that he's a circus clown<br>
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman<br>
Until the other kiddies knock him down</p>
<p>When it snows ain't it thrillin'<br>
Tho' your nose gets a chillin'<br>

<p>Frosty the snowman<br>
Was a happy, jolly soul<br>
With a corncob pipe and a button nose<br>
And two eyes made out of coal</p>
<p>Frosty the snowman<br>
Is a fairy tale they say<br>
He was made of snow, but the children know<br>
How he came to life one day</p>
<p>There must have been some magic in<br>
That old silk hat they found<br>
For when they placed it on his head<br>
He began to dance around</p>
<p>Oh, Frosty the snowman<br>
Was alive as he could be<br>
And the children say<br>
He could laugh and play<br>
Just the same as you and me</p>
<p>(Frosty the snowman)<br>
(Frosty the snowman)</p>
<p>He led them down the streets of town<br>
Right to the traffic cop<br>
And he only paused a moment when<br>
He heard him holler # Stop!#</p>
<p>Frosty the snowman<br>
Had to hurry on his way<br>
But he waved goodbye saying # Don't you cry,<br>
I'll be back again some day.#</p>

<p>Good King Wenceslas looked out<br>
On the feast of Stephen<br>
When the snow lay round about<br>
Deep and crisp and even<br>
Brightly shone the moon that night<br>
Though the frost was cruel<br>
When a poor man came in sight<br>
Gath'ring winter fuel</p>
<p>&quot;Hither, page, and stand by me<br>
If thou know'st it, telling<br>
Yonder peasant, who is he?<br>
Where and what his dwelling?&quot;<br>
&quot;Sire, he lives a good league hence<br>
Underneath the mountain<br>
Right against the forest fence<br>
By Saint Agnes' fountain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bring me flesh and bring me wine<br>
Bring me pine logs hither<br>
Thou and I will see him dine<br>
When we bear him thither.&quot;<br>
Page and monarch forth they went<br>
Forth they went together<br>
Through the rude wind's wild lament<br>
And the bitter weather</p>
<p>&quot;Sire, the night is darker now<br>
And the wind blows stronger<br>
Fails my heart, I know not how,<br>
I can go no longer.&quot;<br>
&quot;Mark my footsteps, my good page<br>
Tread thou in them boldly<br>
Thou shalt find the winter's rage<br>
Freeze thy blood less coldly.&quot;</p>
<p>In his master's steps he trod<br>
Where the snow lay dinted<br>
Heat was in the very sod<br>
Which the Saint had printed<br>
Therefore, Christian men, be sure<br>
Wealth or rank possessing<br>
Ye who now will bless the poor<br>
Shall yourselves find blessing</p>

And His shelter was a stable,<br>
And His cradle was a stall;<br>
With the poor and meek and lowly,<br>
Lived on earth our Savior holy.</p>
<p>And through all<br>
His wondrous childhood,<br>
He would honor and obey,<br>
Love and watch the lowly mother,<br>
In whose gentle arms He lay.<br>
Christian children all should be,<br>
Mild, obedient, good as He.</p>
<p>For He is our child-hood's pattern,<br>
Day by day like us He grew,<br>
He was little, weak, and helpless,<br>
Tears and smiles like us He knew,<br>
And He feeleth for our sadness,<br>
And He shareth in our gladness.</p>
<p>And our eyes at last shall see Him,<br>
Through His own redeeming love;<br>
For that child so dear and gentle,<br>
Is our Lord in heaven above,<br>
And He leads His children on,<br>
To the place where He is gone.</p>
<p>Not in that poor lowly stable,<br>
With the oxen standing by,<br>
We shall see Him, but in heaven,<br>
Set at God's right hand on high;<br>
When like stars<br>
His children crowned,<br>
All in white shall be around.</p>

<p>Silver bells, silver bells<br>
It's Christmas time in the city<br>
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring<br>
Soon it will be Christmas day</p>
<p>City sidewalks, busy sidewalks<br>
Dressed in holiday style<br>
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas</p>
<p>Children laughing, people passing<br>
Meeting smile after smile<br>
And on every street corner, you'll hear</p>
<p>Silver bells, silver bells<br>
It's Christmas time in the city<br>
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring<br>
Soon it will be Christmas day</p>
<p>Strings of street lights, even stop lights<br>
Blink a bright red and green<br>
As the shoppers rush home<br>
With their treasures</p>
<p>Children laughing, people passing<br>
Meeting smile after smile<br>
And above all this bustle, you'll hear</p>
<p>Silver bells, silver bells<br>
It's Christmas time in the city<br>
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring<br>
Soon it will be Christmas day</p>
<p>Silver bells, silver bells<br>
It's Christmas time<br>
Silver bells, silver bells<br>
Soon it will be Christmas day</p>

<p>Hark how the bells,<br>
Sweet silver bells,<br>

<h1><a name="allI"></a>All I Want for Christmas</h1>
<h2>Mariah Carey<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQViqx6GMY"> (YouTube)</a></h2>
<p>I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
There is just one thing I need<br>
I don't care about the presents<br>
Underneath the Christmas tree</p>
<p>I just want you for my own<br>
More than you could ever know<br>
Make my wish come true<br>
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah.</p>
<p>I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
There is just one thing I need<br>
And I don't care about the presents<br>
Underneath the Christmas tree</p>
<p>I don't need to hang my stocking<br>
There upon the fireplace<br>
Santa Claus won't make me happy<br>
With a toy on Christmas Day<br>
I just want you for my own<br>
More than you could ever know<br>
Make my wish come true<br>
All I want for Christmas is you<br>
You, baby</p>
<p>Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas<br>
I won't even wish for snow<br>
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting<br>
Underneath the mistletoe</p>
<p>I won't make a list and send it<br>
To the North Pole for Saint Nick<br>
I won't even stay awake to<br>
Hear those magic reindeer click</p>
<p>'Cause I just want you here tonight<br>
Holding on to me so tight<br>
What more can I do?<br>
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you<br>
You, baby</p>
<p>Oh, all the lights are shining<br>
So brightly everywhere<br>
And the sound of children's<br>
Laughter fills the air</p>
<p>And everyone is singing<br>
I hear those sleigh bells ringing<br>
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?<br>
Won't you please bring my baby to me?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
This is all I'm asking for<br>
I just want to see my baby<br>
Standing right outside my door<br>
Oh, I just want you for my own<br>
More than you could ever know<br>
Make my wish come true<br>
Baby, all I want for Christmas is<br>
You, baby</p>
<p>All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br>
All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br>
All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br>
All I want for Christmas is you, baby.</p>

<img id="candidate-profile-pic" src="/c-profiles/images/parlatoc.jpg" />

<p>Hi everyone. The position I would like to run for is President of AAJ. Although I was not on the committee last year I feel that I would be the perfect candidate for the position. I have had experience on committees and with the revamp of AJJ I feel that a new face in the top position is a positive adjustment not only for AAJ but also for regaining the trust of the ALT and Akita community. I want to build AAJ back up from the ashes starting with a written constitution and getting back to basics. By basics, I donâ€™t just mean focusing on the events but also the organization. AAJ is not just an event planning committee but also an organization for the ALTs of Akita. In order for the events to be a success the organization as a whole needs to improve. I would like AAJ to have clear goals for the year, for example: having a yearly goal of how much money they would like to raise and whether AAJ should focus more on the social aspect of bringing ALTs together or raising money for charity. There is many more ideas that I have in terms of the AAJ rebuild and most important I want to put the dark times behind and move forward into the light.</p>
 
<p>If you think I would be the right candidate for AAJ president, please vote for me.</p>

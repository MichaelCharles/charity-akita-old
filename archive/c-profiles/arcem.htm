<img id="candidate-profile-pic" src="/c-profiles/images/arcem.jpg" />

<p>Hello! I’m Mei and I’d be honored to serve in AAJ in the Vice Chairperson position. AAJ has been an extremely important part of my time here in Japan. I have met many people and have made just as many friends through the events that AAJ has held. Helping out at each event has taught me so much about the group and I was able to see the importance each member of AAJ places on their events. Since and including the welcoming party, I have helped out with setup, door shifts, and bartending to the best of my ability and asked continuously if the AAJ members needed more help. I’m very eager to put in more of my time and effort for AAJ. I believe that AAJ has always been and will continue to be an amazing organization that does its best to raise money for charity and provide a space with great atmosphere for the JET community to gather. I’d love to have the opportunity to bring my best to the AAJ team and help make AAJ even stronger. </p>
 
<p>In college, I was the Vice President of my sorority. Although a sorority, especially a local one, does not have the same reach that AAJ does, working hard to create events for philanthropy and communicating with key people falls very closely with what AAJ does. As Vice President, my duties were very similar to those of a Vice Chairperson of AAJ. My duties included attending every meeting and event, organizing and overseeing philanthropy/charity events including Recruitment Week, and clearly communicating with the community and other board members. Because of this experience and the experiences I’ve had this past year helping the AAJ team, I believe that I am very qualified and a good candidate for this position. I’m very excited for the next year of JET and AAJ and am equally as excited to get started. Let’s make this upcoming year amazing and start with an awesome welcome party for our new JETs!</p>

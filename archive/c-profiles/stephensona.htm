<img id="candidate-profile-pic" src="/c-profiles/images/stephensona.jpg" />

<p>My name is Alana Stephenson, although most of you know me as Lana. I am currently serving as the Vice President of the Akita Association of JETs Charity Organization. Since coming to Akita, I have spent two years working with AAJ, firstly as a volunteer and further in my current role. During my time with AAJ I have accomplished many tasks, such as creating and hosting new events, connecting with the community and working in a team to facilitate larger, better, more inclusive events. Despite the stresses, the ups, downs and pressures of the job, I have loved every aspect of it. I have always been, and am still, strongly invested in AAJ. Through the care, time and energy I have given to AAJ, I have thoroughly proven myself its advocate and supporter through action and in the most honest, faithful way I can. It is with this in mind, that I ask the Akita community to consider me for the position of President in the upcoming 2015-16 year. This bid for the position is one that I take with all seriousness, and one that I consider very close to my heart.
At the helm of any society or association, it is fundamentally important to have someone with relevant experience, and I believe I am the most qualified person for the position. Charity work has always been important in my life and beyond my experience with AAJ in the past; my actual experience of charity work began at a very young age and came very naturally to me. I was raised in a small community very similar to that of Akita, where everyone worked together regularly raising money, working in the community or simply volunteering. This instilled in me a very important group of values; a sense of hard work, responsibility, and caring. Wherever I am, if there is a chance to get involved in helping others, I will be there.  Once I entered University, these values continued to grow as I took on the main role of social secretary in the Japanese society, while juggling study and a part time job. This work helped to strengthen me by teaching me balance in life, and has certainly helped in my years working with AAJ. I also know that these values and experiences will continue to aid me as I work with AAJ in the coming future.</p>
 
<p>
Despite the amazing events we have had this past year, it has become very clear that AAJ needs to move forward this coming year and to evolve into something better. I know that I am ready to take on that responsibility, and hope that I will be able to use my unique skills to continue to serve the Akita community. Changes have already begun with the decision to make a charter. This document will clarify the new direction, focus and values of AAJ and additionally establish roles within the group, together with protocols and boundaries that must be followed. Transparency and communication with the community will be paramount to the new team. Finally, I would like to say what a privilege it has been working for AAJ these past two years. A big thank you to all of the people I have worked with and all those who have attended our events. Thank you for taking time to read my statement.

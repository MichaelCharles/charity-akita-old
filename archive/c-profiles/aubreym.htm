<h3 style="margin-top:5px;">Candidate for Vice-Chairperson</h3>

<img id="candidate-profile-pic" src="/c-profiles/images/aubreym.jpg" />

<p>My name is Michael Aubrey, I am a 2nd year prefectural ALT living in Akita City and I am running for one of the Vice-chairperson positions. My experience living in Japan would not be what it has been without the exceptional community that I have been privileged to be a part of here in Akita. It is a community that has been made possible in part by the efforts of the AAJ team through events and community organizing. I would be honored to have the opportunity to help facilitate its continued growth and vitality. </p>
 
<p>One of the major responsibilities of a vice-chairperson is to help organize the major charity events. I've had some experience working with the previous AAJ team in organizing events, so I am aware of the amount of work and effort that goes into them. A new responsibility of the vice-chairpeople is to promote and set up elections for the new committee members. In seeing the lack of an elections platform, I created CharityAkita.com. In some ways I am already fulfilling this responsibility. In the last few months, when I have seen a need, I've attempted to fill it. I would like to continue to do that in an official capacity. </p>

<p>Despite anything negative I have had to say about the Akita Association of JETs over the last three or four weeks, I am actually truly appreciative of what AAJ has been able to accomplish for and on behalf of the JET community in Akita. Thousands of dollars raised for charity and countless events hosted for our enjoyment are nothing to scoff at. They are truly impressive feats that hopefully inspire us to take a greater part in AAJ or even only our local communities throughout Akita-ken. Unfortunately, it’s not just AAJ’s successes that bring me before you today as a candidate for Treasurer of AAJ, but rather its critical failures.  All of AAJ’s accomplishments cannot excuse the newly apparent lack of organization at AAJ, which I believe is holding it back from realizing its full potential as a pillar of not just the Akita JET community, but also that of the entire Akita-ken. In order for AAJ to succeed, it must undergo significant structural reforms that will serve as the foundation for smooth, transparent, and accountable operation of all AAJ activities in the future.</p>
 
<p>AAJ, as it currently stands, does not have a charter or by-laws that govern how it operates. There’s no clearly defined mission statement. Prior to this election, there appears to have been no obvious distinction between committee member roles. Critically, there also been a lack of procedures to ensure financial transparency or accountability, which has proven to be quite problematic throughout the past JET year. This has to change, and as Treasurer of AAJ, in addition to handling regular financial affairs, I would also help to see through reforms that remedy all of the failures outlined above. Should reforms be implemented, I fully expect AAJ to continue to grow, and become a bigger and better part of the Akita JET community. Not only would the day-to-day management of AAJ be improved, but the transparency and accountability that proper reforms would provide should also restore the community’s faith in this organization. With your support, I’d like an opportunity to be a part of the team that changes AAJ for the better. Thank you.  </p>

<img id="candidate-profile-pic" src="/c-profiles/images/youngbloodr.jpg" />

<p>As a fifth year Akita JET, I have attended countless events put on by the Akita Association of Jets Charity group. From volunteering to simply enjoying myself, I have seen all of these events from a variety of perspectives. I would now like to utilize this knowledge in order to help promote and expand many of the AAJ yearly events. While work has already begun within AAJ to create a marked and important change from past years, it will take dedication and a concentrated effort to fulfil the Akita community’s needs, and see many of these new ideas and changes through to fruition.</p>
 
<p>A new era of AAJ has begun this year and a need has been created in terms of public relations. I believe that it is of vital importance for the future of AAJ that new events and changes to the organization be presented with transparency and inclusion to the Akita JET community. I have a great interest, and believe that I possess a capable knowledge, on how events are, and can be, presented, promoted and perceived. If the Akita community sees fit, I would like to apply this knowledge and skill to the Akita Association of JETs’s Public Relations chair. It would be my pleasure to help create and facilitate a dialogue between the Akita community and AAJ in the future preparation and formation of events to benefit the community as a whole. Thank you for your time and consideration. </p>

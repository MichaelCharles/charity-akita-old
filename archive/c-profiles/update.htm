<h1 class="entry-title">Updates on this Morning's Election Problems</h1>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">Election polls will reopen at 1:00pm today (2015/07/23).</span> The polls went up at 9:07am. I received a message informing me that Chey's profile was not displaying correctly at 9:20am. The candidate profile pages and the election poll itself were pulled from the website the first chance I got, around 9:40am. By that time three votes had been entered.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:red;">The election poll was reset at 11:50am. All users who voted before then will need to vote again.</span> Seeing as Chey's position was not being displayed in the best way possible, in the interest of being fair, I reset the poll. This means that all votes entered up to that point were deleted.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">What happened? Why was Chey's profile displaying wrong?</span> All of the profiles started as <a href="http://www.charityakita.com/candidate-profile/?page=template">this template page</a>. Chey's candidate profile still had some of the Greek filler text. This was just a mistake on my part. When I copy and pasted her campaign essay, I must've forgot to delete part of the template text.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Was this really such a big deal?</span> Probably not. And it is an easy thing to fix. But when I received the message that something was messing up, I was in the middle of giving interview tests and I had no time to look at it properly. I assumed the worst and pulled the election materials the first chance I got.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">9:07am? Why not 9:00am?</span> WordPress has a post scheduling system. Since I was in interview tests, I was relying on that to make the post. Something about it wasn't set up correctly, and I had to manually log in and submit the post. I'm still not 100% sure why it didn't work, but I think it might be because WordPress treated the post as a draft and not as something ready to be published. I'll look into this when I have more time. </p>

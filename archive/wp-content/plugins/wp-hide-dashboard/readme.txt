Hide the Dashboard menu, Personal Options section and Help link on the Profile page from your subscribers when they are logged in.

== Description ==

A simple plugin that removes the Dashboard menu, the Personal Options section and the Help link on the Profile page, hides the Dashboard links in the toolbar menu (if activated), and prevents Dashboard access to users assigned to the <em>Subscriber</em> role. Useful if you allow your subscribers to edit their own profiles, but don't want them wandering around your WordPress admin section.

Users belonging to any of the other WordPress roles will continue to see and have access to the other sections of the WordPress admin that correspond to their role's capabilities.

WP Hide Dashboard has been tested with WordPress in Single mode and Multisite mode, and works with both of them.

<strong>Note: Version 2.2 requires a minimum of WordPress 3.4. If you are running a version less than that, please upgrade your WordPress install before installing or upgrading.</strong>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q. Why did you remove support for other roles from Version 2.1?**

I removed support for menu items for roles other than Subscriber. WP Hide Dashboard is a simple plugin, and was built for the Subscriber role. While I appreciate that some users need this type of functionality for other roles, most don't require it, so I don't want to bloat the plugin with unnecessary code for the majority of users.

If you need to hide admin sidebar menu links from roles other than Subscriber, I recommend using the [Admin Menu Editor plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-menu-editor/ "Admin Menu Editor plugin") to accomplish that goal. Currently it only removes links in the admin sidebar menu. The plugin author has indicated they may add support for removing admin bar menu links in a future version.

**Q. How do I change this to hide the Dashboard link, Tools menu, Personal Options, and Help options from other roles besides Subscriber?**

A. Sorry, I no longer support this plugin working for any role other than Subscriber.

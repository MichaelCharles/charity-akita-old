Adds language indicators (flag, locale or language) beside the site title of sites to help identify similarly named sites in multilingual multisites.

== Description ==

A plugin that adds language indicators, either a flag, locale or language, beside the site title of sites to help identify similarly
named sites in multilingual multisites. This is most helpfull in sites with admin language selectors, where the admin language does not
reflect the site language.

There is a French translation of this plugin included. The French translation was created mostly to test the localization of the plugin.
It's a "machine" translation, and as a result, not very good. If you can improve it, or provide translations for other languages, please let me know.

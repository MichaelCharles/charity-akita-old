Create a static copy of your WordPress site that you can serve on your favorite web server.

== Description ==

Simply Static is a static site generator for WordPress that helps you create a static site that you can serve separately from your WordPress installation. This provides a couple benefits. One, this allows you to keep WordPress in a secure location that no one can access but you. Two, your static site is going to be really, _really_ fast.

= Security =

WordPress is used by one in four websites[1]. That makes it a prime target for hackers. There are a lot of ways that your site can be compromised, but two-thirds of all hacks are caused by vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins, themes, and core files[2].

Keeping WordPress secure requires constant vigilance. Exploits are being found for WordPress themes and plugins every day. Even WordPress itself has critical vulnerabilities from time to time. If you don’t stay on top of updates, your site *will* get hacked. It’s just a matter of when.

But what if there was an easy way to keep WordPress secure? What if you could lock WordPress away somewhere where no one can get to it but you?

With Simply Static you can put your WordPress installation in a secure location and publish a static site for the rest of the world to see. You can keep WordPress at a secret URL, protect it with .htaccess, or even put it behind a VPN. Simply Static will create static copies of all of the pages from your WordPress installation and replace the URLs to match where you’ll be hosting it.

= Performance =

Every time you visit a WordPress page it needs to perform database queries to fetch content and run PHP code to render the page. These actions take time to perform.

With Simply Static, you’re creating a static copy of all of your WordPress pages. That time to create each page is incurred once, when Simply Static runs. When someone visits your static site they can instantly receive the page because Simply Static already did the work of creating it.

Depending on the complexity of your site, theme, and plugins, using a static site can easily increase the performance of your site by 10x.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does Simply Static do? =

Simply Static generates static (HTML) copies of your WordPress pages. It works a bit like a web crawler, starting at the main page of your website and looking for links to other pages to create static copies of. It also includes any images, CSS & JS files, and any other files that it can find a link to.

As Simply Static is creating the static pages, it will automatically replace the URL for the WordPress installation with the URL for the site that you're going to have hosting the static files. So if WordPress is hosted at wordpress.example.com and your static site will be at www.example.com, all instances of wordpress.example.com will be replaced with www.example.com.

= Who should use Simply Static? =

Simply Static is great for sites with no user interactivity, such as blogs (with comments disabled) or brochure-ware sites for small businesses (with no forms).

= Are there any limitations? =

Yes. Simply Static is only able to create a static copy of an entire site. It cannot selectively create static copies of specific pages, such as recently added posts. This means that if you have a site with 20,000 posts, and you add a new post, Simply Static will create a static copy of all 20,001 posts. This, combined with the fact that the plugin doesn't provide any kind of progress notification, means that Simply Static will provide a less-than-optimal experience for very large WordPress sites. We do plan to support very large sites eventually.

= How do I set up Simply Static? =

Let's assume you presently have WordPress hosting a site at www.example.com, and that's where you'd like to have your static site instead. Your first task is going to be to move your WordPress installation to a subdomain, such as wordpress.example.com. Once that is complete, you'll set up www.example.com to receive your static files.

If www.example.com is on the same server as your WordPress installation, you can have Simply Static copy the static files to the directory that www.example.com is serving files from. If www.example.com is on a different server, you can download a zip of your static files and then upload them to www.example.com.

= Will this plugin interfere with other plugins? =

Simply Static's output is just a collection of static files: HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc. Any functionality that would require PHP in order to function will not work. That includes, but is not limited to: blog post comments, contact forms, forums, membership areas, and eCommerce.

Note that you can achieve some of this functionality by using plugins that interact with third-party services. For example, for blog post comments you could use [Disqus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/) and for forms you could use [Wufoo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wufoo-shortcode/).

= How is Simply Static different from cache plugins? =

Cache plugins -- such as W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache -- make your existing WordPress site faster by caching pages as they're visited. This makes your site much faster, but still leaves your WordPress installation accessible to the outside world. Unless you keep on top of updates, your WordPress installation can become vulnerable to hackers due to security vulnerabilities that are found over time.

Simply Static creates a copy of your WordPress site that is intended to be used completely separately from your WordPress installation. Your WordPress installation lives on one server and your static site is served on a different server. Or, they're both on the same server, but your WordPress installation is restricted to only allow access from certain ip addresses or with an additional username/password requirement. Your static site is just a collection of static files with no server-side code or database -- nothing for hackers to hack -- while your WordPress installation remains safe and secure.

= Does Simply Static work on Windows hosts? What about WAMP? =

No. We haven't done any testing on Windows and, based on user feedback, it seems like it is not working on Windows presently.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Simply Static General Settings page. Set your Origin URL (for your WordPress installation), your Destination URL (for your static site), choose your Delivery Method, and you're ready to generate your static site.
2. This is what the Simply Static Generate page looks like after you've generated your static files. We'll show you exactly which files we made a static copy of.

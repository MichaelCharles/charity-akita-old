<p><strong>Charity Akita</strong> is an unincorporated non-profit voluntary association that works to strengthen the expat and Japanese community by providing opportunities for people to connect, and to pass on the legacy of volunteerism in Akita prefecture. </p>

<p>To that end Charity Akita organizes volunteer opportunities, fundraisers, social gatherings and other events. We strive to support local causes and charities, primarily those located within Akita prefecture and the Tohoku region.</p>

<p>On June 13th, 2016 a charter was passed by vote which clarified the organization's structure and purpose, and renamed the organization from "Akita Association of JETs" to "Charity Akita." That charter is available to view here in both English and Japanese.</p>

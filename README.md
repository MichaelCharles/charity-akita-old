## Material Design Lite

Currently Tekkamikey comes set up for Google's [Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io/started/index.html). As of now I'm trying to use this in all of my projects to learn it. If I decide to move on to something else, this will likely change. 

## Social Network Metadata

In the header of ```index.html``` there are three sections of metadata which correspond to the metadata that Facebook, Twitter, and Google look for.

## Japanese Support

### 日本語でおｋ！

The ```style.css``` comes with a ```ja``` class that has a simple Japanese text font stack. When applied to an element, the Japanese text within it will render with the most modern Japanese font available to the user. Japanese fonts tend to be rather large, so its often better to use whatever is already available on the machine instead of downloading a webfont. 


## What's with the name?

It's a play on the Japanese word "tekka maki" and my name (Michael). Tekka maki are small pieces of sushi filled with tuna.
